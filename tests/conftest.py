"""
This is the root pytest configuration file for the rhosocial-activerecord-postgres package's test suite.

Its primary responsibility is to configure the environment so that the external
`rhosocial-activerecord-testsuite` can find and use the backend-specific
implementations (Providers) defined within this project.

import os



# Set the environment variable that the testsuite uses to locate the provider registry.
# The testsuite is a generic package and doesn't know the specific location of the
# provider implementations for this backend (postgres). This environment variable
# acts as a bridge, pointing the testsuite to the correct import path.
#
# `setdefault` is used to ensure that this value is set only if it hasn't been
# set already, allowing for overrides in different environments if needed.
